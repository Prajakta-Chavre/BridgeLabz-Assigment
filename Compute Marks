/*ComputeMarks Write a program that takes the student name, Physics,  Chemistry, and Mathematics Marks of student as input. For each subject, marks are out of 100. Compute the total marks of that student, percentage in each  subject and total percentage.  
Print the out as “[Student Name] obtained following % of marks in PCM:  Physics: [% in Physics ], Chemistry : [% in Chem], Maths : [% in Maths]  Total : [Total %]”
